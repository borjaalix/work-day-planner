For this project I went through several steps for the end project:

1. I set up the moment format to show the current day, month, and year.

2. Connected the new javascript file to the html.

3. I set up time up the timeblock rows using bootstrap formatting for the columns, text-areas, and save buttons. Also made sure that the classes match what shows within the stylesheet.

4. I set up the function for the save button's addeventlistener and used variables that were declared for the descriptions and ids within the html. Then set those variables to save in the local storage.

5. Next I was able to set up the remove and add class within an if - else if - else statement for the timeblocks.

6. Finally ran localstorage.getItem for the hours within the timeblocks and then ran the time function again.
